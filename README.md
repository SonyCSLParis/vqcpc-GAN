# VQCPC-GAN
VQCPC-GAN is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for synthesizing variable-length tonal audio. The details can be found in our paper submittted to WASPAA 2021: J.Nistal, C. Aouameur, S. Lattner, and G. Richard "VQCPC-GAN: Variable-length Adversarial Audio Synthesis using Vector-Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding". It achieves audio quality comparable to a GANSynth baselines on the NSynth Dataset and enables the synthesis of variable-length audio, instead of fixed-duration 4s-long sounds.

Sound examples can be found in the accompanying [sonycslparis.github.io/vqcpc-gan.io](url).
